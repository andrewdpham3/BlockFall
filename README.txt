Intro:
This project is to create a 2D force and motion physics model display. The forces will be gravity and
impacts between rectangular blocks (and a ball) and the floor and walls. The collisions will be elastic,
and the bricks will be allowed to rotate as a result of collisions.

External Requirements: A javascript enabled web browser. I used Google Chrome.

Build, Installation, and Setup: Open the runme html document in a web browser.

Usage: There is no user input, refresh the webpage to restart the simulation.

Extra Features: More than one circle, gravity will eventually stop the simulation regardless of 100% kinetic transfer on collision.

Bugs: None

This build calls upon the javascript library "matter".
